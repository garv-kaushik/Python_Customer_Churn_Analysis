# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data for a telecom company. The goal is to identify key factors that influence customer churn and provide insights that can help reduce it.

## 📌 Project Overview

* Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python.
* Visualized customer demographics, services, contracts, and payment details to understand churn behavior.
* Highlighted patterns and trends that differentiate churned customers from retained ones.

## 📊 Key Insights from Analysis

* **Contract Type:** Customers on month-to-month contracts show a much higher churn rate compared to those on yearly contracts.
* **Internet Service:** Fiber optic users tend to churn more than DSL users.
* **Payment Method:** Customers using electronic checks have the highest churn percentage.
* **Tenure:** Long-term customers (higher tenure) are less likely to churn, while new customers show high churn probability.
* **Total Charges:** Lower total charges (newer customers) correlate with higher churn.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization


## 📢 Conclusion

The analysis highlights that **contract type, payment method, and tenure** are strong indicators of churn. Targeted retention strategies for month-to-month customers and those paying via electronic check could help reduce churn rates.
